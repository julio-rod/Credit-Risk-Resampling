# Credit Risk Analysis with Logistic Regression Models
### Note: This repository is for educational purposes only.

This project aims to compare the performance of two logistic regression models in predicting the credit risk of loans.

# Overview
This involves the following steps:
1. Split the dataset into training and testing sets
2. create a logistic regression model with the original data.
3. Predict with a logistic regression model using resampled training data.

# Installation and Setup
- You can download Python from the official website: [Python](https://www.python.org/)

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Navigate to your local project directory using `cd`
3. Install the required Python packages `pip install -r requirements .txt`

# Technologies
- Python
- pandas
- sickit-learn

# Summary
The logistic regression model with the resampled data demopnstrates a significant improvement in predicting high risk loans compared to the model with original data.
It is recomended to use the logistic regression model with the resampled data for credit risk analysis, as it provides better performance in predicting both healthy and high risk loans.
